# Dream_Game
Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you very much for your time.

I am a person who has to do things that I don't like because of the force of life. I have been fond of games since childhood, and I like the feelings and thoughts it brings. I think it is the carrier of the author's spirit and ideas, and a form of expressing the author's spirit or ideas...


I hope to finish it in my lifetime, and although I don't know exactly what it will be like in the end, I know it will have some of my experiences in the story book.

It would be great if someone could communicate and study with me. My email is 1539531987@qq.com. Thank you very much!!!
